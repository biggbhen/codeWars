// Escape the room
// You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

var rooms = {
	room1: { name: 'room1', description: 'fun', completed: true },
	room2: { name: 'room2', description: 'scary', completed: false },
	room3: { name: 'room3', description: 'locked', completed: true },
};
